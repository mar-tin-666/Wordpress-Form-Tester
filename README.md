# ðŸ§ª Wordpress Form Tester (in Pytjon with Playwright & Email Validation)

This project provides automated end-to-end tests for Wordpress forms using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) and `pytest`.  
It supports dynamic configuration via YAML, and validates not only the form behavior but also the content of confirmation emails (including attachments).
Prepared and tested on Wordpress forms based on Contact Form 7.

---

## Features

- Submits web forms based on YAML-defined structure
- Validates form error messages for required fields
- Checks autoresponder and internal (admin/HR) email content
- Verifies attached files in emails
- Works in headless mode (default) - if you want to change edit the conftest.py file

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

---

## Configuration

Create a YAML file in `config/form_config.yaml`.  
Example file: `config/form_config_example.yaml`.  
This file defines:

- Target URL
- Form field structure
- Validation messages
- Email access credentials
- Expected email content


## Running the Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Headless / Headed

```bash
HEADLESS=true pytest      # default
HEADLESS=false pytest     # run with visible browser
```
